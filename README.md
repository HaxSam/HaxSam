## Hi there! I'm HaxSam / Hax5am 👋

But enough of that...

## About Me 😄

> I love to programm in Javascript/Typescript. ❤

I am 19 years old. 😀

I mostly program in Javascript or Typescript and use Node.js for that, but I am really looking forward to Deno 😍😍.

Unfortunately I'm often more busy looking for new projects than actually coding something. 😓
